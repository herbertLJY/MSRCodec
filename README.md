## Overview

Audio codecs are a critical component of modern speech generation systems. This paper introduces a low-bitrate, multi-scale residual codec that encodes speech into four distinct streams: semantic, timbre, prosody, and residual. This architecture achieves high-fidelity speech reconstruction at competitive low bitrates while demonstrating an inherent ability for information disentanglement. We construct a two-stage language model for text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis using this codec, which, despite its lightweight design and minimal data requirements, achieves a state-of-the-art Word Error Rate (WER) and superior speaker similarity compared to several larger models. Furthermore, the codec’s design proves highly effective for voice conversion, enabling independent manipulation of speaker timbre and prosody.

## Basic Usage

You can simply run the demo with the following commands:
``` sh
bash infer.sh
```

Alternatively, you can modify the script to generate your speeches：

``` sh
python ignore inference.py \
    --prompt_wav assets/src/121_127105_000009_000000.wav \
    --prompt_text "We say, of course, somebody exclaimed, that they give two turns!" \
    --gen_text "How are you? This is lightspeed studio from tencent." \
    --output_dir out_dir
```

## **Demos**

Here are some demos generated by MSR-Codec for zero-shot TTS and voice conversion, please visit our [demo page](https://herbertljy.github.io/MSRCodec/).
